<h3>Introduction!!!</h3>
									
									
									<p>Multi-drug bacterial resistance is classified as an urgent threat to globalized health care by the World Health Organization. Traditional antibiotics attack only sepcific metabolic pahtways and are limited to either gram-negative (G-) or gram-positive (G+), but rarely both. This method of attack also allows bacteria to relatively easily develop resistance, often within a week. However, the newest line of defense against these bacterial attacks are engineered cationic antimicrobial peptides or eCAPs. These molecules attack the negatively charged headgroups of lipid membranes rather than specific metabolic pathways, delaying resistance by a factor of four.</p>
									<p>Using a variety of techniques, including neutron reflectrometry, X-ray diffuse scattering (WAXS and LAXS), circular dichrosim (CD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations we can identify mechanisms of action for the way these peptides attack lipid membranes. We use lipid model membranes to mimic the function of G(-) inner and outer membrane, G(+), and eukaryotic membranes to track the changes in location of the peptides, and the thickness/area of the membranes. These values have lead us to a domain theory wherein the peptides, once associated with the lipid membranes, create regions of extreme softness and extreme stiffness, which disallows the flucuations of the membrane. Along the walls between these regions ions and water molecules can leak through, eventually disrupting the interior of the cell and eventually causing death. The method by which peptides complete this differs with both the peptide and the membrane. Our ultimate goal is to create long-lasting alternatives to traditional antibiotics and prevent bacterial infection from becoming a global health threat.</p>
